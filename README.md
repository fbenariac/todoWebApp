# TodoWebApp

## What that ?

this is a simple todo app build with rails 5.

## Todo list:
  * Add some UI and UX
  * Install paper_trail to follow tasks history versions.
  * Set up rake doc:app ;-)

## Debug/WTF:
  * Check non logged acces to tasks... :-/
  * Do/redo: Test about sign_in (user redirect after sign_in and sign_out, user_rule ok and user_rule failed)

## Ideas:
  * Add a desktop app which use this website API.
