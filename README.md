# TodoWebApp

## What that ?

This is a simple todo app build with rails 5.

## Todo list:
  * Set nice forms (with bootstrap) for Create/Update and for login/signup
  * Add js lib to add UI (drag/drop to change task priority and later task's state)
  * Add sections: ['todo', 'wip', 'done'] to tasks' home
  * Add ajax action to update case status from home (todo/wip/done)
  * Feature: be able to use label for each task.
  * Set tasks avancements status. (task.status)
  * Add a tasks/list container (todo for work / todo for Home / todo for deadline)
  * Add a deadline to todolist with reminder (ical)
  * Use [responders](https://github.com/plataformatec/responders) instead of custom respond_to for each formats


## Debug/WTF:

## Ideas:
  * Add a desktop app which use this website API (json).
