# TodoWebApp

## What that ?

This is a simple todo app build with rails 5.

## Todo list:

  * Add some UI and UX (Set bootstraps' classes everywhere !)
  * Set nice forms (with bootstrap) for Create and Update
  * Add sections: ['todo', 'wip', 'done'] to tasks' home
  * Add ajax action to update case status from home (todo/wip/done)
  * Feature: be able to use label for each task.
  

## Debug/WTF:

## Ideas:
  * Add a desktop app which use this website API.
