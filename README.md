# TodoWebApp

## What that ?

this is a simple todo app build with rails 5.

## Todo list:
  * Add some UI and UX
  * Install paper_trail to follow tasks history versions.

## Debug/WTF:
  * Redirect to home after login ??? We should get our "userspace", with our tasks list.
  
## Ideas:
  * Add a desktop app which use this website API.
